\section{Luminosity Determination}

Our statistical uncertainties on $A_{LL}$ assume perfect knowledge of the relative luminosity of the different spin states.  This systematic addresses that simplification.

\subsection{Uncertainty Evaluation Using the ZDCs}

\textit{Note: \href{http://mare.tamu.edu/star/2005n06Jets/2005relLumSys_mar29_2008/}{analysis by Murad Sarsour}}

We can quantify the precision with which we understand the relative luminosities in the BBC by using an independent luminosity monitor, the ZDCs.  In the absence of non-statistical fluctuations, the uncertainty on R will be dominated by the statistics in the ZDCs, which count at a much lower rate than the BBCs during proton-proton running.

A couple of problems in the ZDC data need to be corrected before a comparison to the BBCs can be trusted.  The first problem is due to the ``killer bit'' algorithm, which suppressed signals in the ZDCs for 10 bunch crossings after an initial signal.  The algorithm is used in heavy ion running to prevent ringing in the calorimeters from generating false signals, but in pp running it biases the ZDC counts.  Bunch crossings immediately following abort gaps (where the killer bit is more likely to be off) end up with more ZDC counts than crossings in the middle of a filled set of bunches.  As a result, the ratio of relative luminosities obtained from the ZDC and BBC will not be flat, see Figure \ref{fig:zdctobbc6170012zoom}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Ratio of ZDC and BBC counts versus bunch crossing.  Notice that the ratio is larger in bunch crossings immediately following abort gaps.}
  \label{fig:zdctobbc6170012zoom}
\end{figure}

The procedure developed to correct for this effect requires scaling the counts for a given bunch crossing by a factor that takes into account the frequency with which the previous ten bunch crossings had a signal.  For the ZDC singles rates, the formula for the corrected counts $n_{j}$ in a given bunch crossing $j$ is
%
\begin{equation}
  n_{j}^{corrected} = n_{j} * \frac{N_{cycles}}{N_{cycles} - \sum_{i=1}^{10}n_{j-i}}
\end{equation}
%
where $N_{cycles}$ is the number of times the beams cycled through STAR in the run.  Figure \ref{fig:zdc-singles-ratio} shows the effect of applying the correction for a sample run.

\end{figure}

The formula to correct the ZDC coincidence counts is complicated by the need to track the killer bits for the two detectors simultaneously.  The formula for the corrected coincidence counts $c_{j}$ given singles counts $e_{j}$ (ZCDE) and $w_{j}$ (ZDCW) is
%
\begin{align}
  &\alpha_{j} = N_{cycles} - \sum_{i=1}^{10}c_{j-i} \notag\\
  &\beta_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{10}(e_{j} + w_{j} - 2*c_{j}) - \sum_{i=1}^{9}\left[\frac{(e_{j}-c_{j}) * (w_{j}-c_{j})}{\alpha_{j}-(e_{j-10}-c_{j-10})} + \frac{(e_{j}-c_{j}) * (w_{j}-c_{j})}{\alpha_{j}-(w_{j-10}-c_{j-10})}\right] + ... \notag\\
  &c_{j}^{corrected} = c_{j} * \frac{N_{cycles}}{\alpha_{j} - \beta_{j}} 
\end{align}
%
and the effect of the killer bit correction on the coincidence distributions is shown in Figure \ref{fig:coinRat6143016}

  \label{fig:c7308}
\end{figure}

The second problem that we need to correct has come to be known as the ``even-odd'' effect.  It turns out that the ZDC coincidence rates are often different for even-numbered and odd-numbered bunch crossings.  This oscillation can introduce a false asymmetry if it aligns coherently with a particular spin pattern.  For instance, in Figure \ref{fig:c7308} we see that the ZDC coincidence rates are always higher when the spin of the blue beam is down.  Figure \ref{fig:fevfod} shows the time dependence of this even-odd oscillation, with the colors now representing individual fills.  To quantify the bias this introduces on $A_{LL}$, we can define the fractional overlap between the even-odd ZDC oscillation and relevant portion of the spin pattern for $A_{LL}$ using a 120 element vector $|EO\rangle = |+1,-1,+1,-1,...\rangle$ and another 120 element vector $|LL\rangle$ whose elements are 1 if the bunch crossing is UU or DD, -1 if UD or DU, and 0 otherwise.  The inner product of these vectors measures the susceptibility of $A_{LL}$ for that spin pattern to any even-odd oscillation.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fevfod}
  \caption{Magnitude of even-odd rate asymmetry versus time.}
  \label{fig:fevfod}
\end{figure}

It turns out that $A_{LL}$ is less biased by the even-odd rate oscillation in the ZDC than, say, the blue beam single-spin asymmetry.  Figure \ref{fig:cll} plots the fill-by-fill change in $A_{LL}$  if the ZDC is used for relative luminosities instead of the BBC against the the product of the fractional overlap $F \equiv \langle EO | LL \rangle$ and the magnitude of the even-odd oscillation $S-1$.  Placing a cut on $|F*(S-1)| < 0.002$ is well-motivated.  For fills without reliable ZDC information, we use Figure \ref{fig:fevfod} to assume a conservative $|S-1| = 0.03$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[]{figures/cll}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Change in $A_{LL}$ versus the product of the even-odd rate oscillation amplitude and the fractional overlap $\langle EO | LL \rangle$.  Deviations from 0 on the x-axis indicate fills where $A_{LL}$ is biased by the even-odd effect.}
  \label{fig:cll}
\end{figure}

After correcting for the killer bits and rejecting the fills that fail the even-odd oscillation cut the uncertainty on $A_{LL}$ due to the uncertainty in the relative luminosities is estimated to be $9.32\times10^{-4}$.

\subsection{Beam Background Bias}

\textit{Note: \href{http://www.star.bnl.gov/protected/spin/kowalik/2005/r-lumi/bkg_sys.html}{analysis by Kasia Kowalik}}

The relative luminosities obtained from the BBCs might also be biased by false signals generated by beam-gas background.  We can try to quantify this by studying the coincidence rate in crossings where one of the two beams has an unfilled bunch (``abort gaps'').  The beam-gas background is assumed to be crossing- and spin-independent, but it can be different in each beam.  It follows that the per-crossing coincidence rate due to beam-gas in each beam is just the average number of BBC coincidences found in the abort gaps for that beam.  In Figure \ref{fig:bkg-yellow-blue}, the x-axis is the background rate divided by the total rate, defined as the average number of coincidences per bunch crossing with a spin state of UU, UD, DU, or DD.  The two histograms are incremented for each STAR run.  We see that the background rate in the BBCs due to beam-gas is typically less than 0.1\% of the total rate.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/bkg-yellow-blue}
  \caption{Fraction of the total coincidence rate attributed to beam gas in each beam.  The histograms are incremented once for each STAR run.}
  \label{fig:bkg-yellow-blue}
\end{figure}

Given run-dependent background fractions for both beams, it's possible to calculate background-subtracted relative luminosities.  Figure \ref{fig:r-lumi-sys-bkg} shows the difference between the raw relative luminosity and the background-subtracted version.  The background-corrected relative luminosities yield an $A_{LL}$ that differs from the original by $3.0\times10^{-4}$, so we use that as the uncertainty for this source of systematic error.
