\section{First Experimental Tests}

In polarized deep inelastic scattering, a longitudinally polarized lepton beam
is scattered off of nucleon targets polarized parallel or perpendicular to the
beam axis. Asymmetries are formed by comparing event rates for scattering in
different spin configurations. For a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ target, the
asymmetries of interest are

% Stiegler does not include the 1/2 nor the differential in this equation
\begin{equation}
  A_{\parallel} = \frac{d\sigma^{\rightarrow \Leftarrow} - d\sigma^{\rightarrow \Rightarrow}}{2d\sigma_{unpol}}, ~~~~~~~
  A_{\perp} = \frac{d\sigma^{\rightarrow \Uparrow} - d\sigma^{\rightarrow \Downarrow}}{2d\sigma_{unpol}}
\end{equation}

Spin-dependent cross sections can be calculated by contracting the elastic
Compton amplitude $T_{\mu \nu}$ with the photon polarization vectors; in the
presence of parity conservation and time reversal, four of these are
independent \cite{}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sigma_{1/2} & = & F_1 + g_1 - \gamma^2 g_2, \nonumber \\
  \sigma_{3/2} & = & F_1 - g_1 + \gamma^2 g_2, \nonumber \\
  \sigma_L & = & -F_1 + F_2(1+\gamma^2)/(2x),  \nonumber \\
  \sigma_{TL} & = & \sqrt{2}\gamma (g_1+g_2).
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here $\gamma^2 = Q^2/v^2$. These four cross sections are commonly rearranged
into a pair of virtual photon asymmetries $A_1$ and $A_2$:
%
\begin{equation}
  A_1 = \frac{\sigma_{1/2} - \sigma_{3/2}}{\sigma_{1/2} + \sigma_{3/2}}, ~~~~ A_2 = \frac{\sigma_{TL}}{\sigma_T}
\end{equation}
%
The longitudinal and transverse DIS asymmetries can then be written in terms
of these virtual photon asymmetries. In the case of $A_{\parallel}$ we have
\begin{equation}
  A_{\parallel} = D(A_1 + \eta A_2),
\end{equation}
%
where the coefficients $D$ and $\eta$ can be approximated to first order in
$\gamma$ in terms of the usual DIS kinematic variables and $R =
\frac{\sigma_{L}}{\sigma_T}$:
% include coeffs for A_perp here too?
% Detailed derivation of these results can be found in \cite{Anselmino:1994gn}
\begin{equation}
  D \approx \frac{y(2-y)}{y^2 + 2(1-y)(1+R)}, ~~~~~~~~ \eta \approx \frac{2(1-y)}{y(2-y)} \frac{\sqrt{Q^2}}{E}.
\end{equation}
%
(Similar equations exist for $A_{\perp}$, such that a measurement of both
asymmetries allows an extraction of both $A_1$ and $A_2$). $D$ can be thought
of as a depolarization factor arising from the fact that the photon is not
fully aligned with the lepton beam, and $\eta$ is a kinematic factor that is
usually small. Finally, the polarized structure functions can be written in
terms of $A_{1,2}$:
\begin{equation}
  g_1 = \frac{F_2}{2x(1+R)}(A_1+\gamma A_2), ~~~~~ g_2 = \frac{F_2}{2x(1+R)}(A_2/\gamma - A_1).
\end{equation}
Thus, measurements of $A_{\parallel}$, $A_{\perp}$, $F_2$, and $R$ are
sufficient to extract the polarized structure functions of the nucleon.

% note that they just measured A_parallel and placed a limit on the A_2 contribution
The first DIS experiments to extract $g_1$ using this methodology were E80 and
E130, conducted in the late 1970s and early 1980s at SLAC. These experiments
scattered longitudinally polarized electron beams off of longitudinally
polarized proton targets and were able to measure $A_{\parallel}^p$ in the
range $0.1 < x < 0.7$. Using the positivity limit $A_2 < \sqrt{R}$ they
determined that $A_{\parallel}/D$ was a good approximation for $A_1$, and
after exploiting that assumption their results were consistent with
expectations from the parton model \cite{Alguard:1976bm, Baum:1983ha}.
% there are 2-3 more result papers cited in Baum:1983ha if I want them

In 1988, the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) published data on asymmetries
of longitudinally polarized muon beams scattering off of longitudinally
polarized proton targets. The EMC experiment boasted kinematic coverage down
to $x = 0.01$, an order of magnitude lower than the earlier SLAC experiments,
and the Collaboration extracted measurements of the proton's $g_1$ structure
function using the same assumption that $A_1 \approx A_{\parallel}/D$. The EMC
data on $A_1$ were consistent with the results from SLAC in their overlapping
kinematic regime, but at low $x$ the EMC results deviated significantly from
parton model predictions. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:emc-g1p}, the integral
value of $g_1^p$ obtained from the EMC extraction was incompatible with the
prediction from Ellis and Jaffe. Applying the Bjorken sum rule to obtain a
(significantly negative) value for the integral of $g_1^n$, EMC quoted the
following quark spin contribution to the spin of the proton
\cite{Ashman:1987hv}: % Ashman:1989ig might be the authoritative source
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle S_z \rangle_{u+d} = 0.068 \pm 0.047 \pm 0.103.
\end{equation}
%
This result sparked what was once termed a ``spin crisis'' in particle
physics. Sucessive polarized DIS experiments at CERN, SLAC, and DESY confirmed
and refined the EMC measurement of $g_1^p$ with improved precision over a
wider kinematic range \cite{Adams:1994zd}, and measured both $g_1^n$
\cite{Anthony:1993uf} and $g_1^d$ \cite{Adeva:1993km} which allowed a
verification of the critical Bjorken sum rule.

\end{figure}

Even in that context, the EMC result was surprising. Applying the Bjorken sum
rule to obtain $\int g_1^n$ and again assuming an unpolarized sea, one can
solve for the individual quark spin contributions to the spin of the proton:

\begin{equation}
  \int_0^1 dx~g_1^p(x,Q^2) - g_1^n(x,Q^2) = \frac{g_A}{6}(1 + O(\alpha_s))
\end{equation}

% Rearranging \ref{eqn:g1} to solve for $\Delta \Sigma$ and plugging in values from \ref{eqn:beta-decay} and EMC one finds
% 
% \begin{equation}
%   \Delta \Sigma = 9\Gamma_1^p - \frac{3}{4}a_3 - \frac{1}{4}a_8 = 
% \end{equation}
% 
%   The data covered a sufficient range
% EMC measures first moment of g1, taking a3 and a8 from beta-decay measurements means that we can extract a0 from $\Gamma_1^p$ and it's $\sim$ 0.  But
% 
% \begin{equation}
%   a_0 = \Delta \Sigma = a_8 + 3(\Delta s + \Delta \bar{s})
% \end{equation}
% 
% from above, and if you ignore strange quark contributions (Ellis-Jaffe) you get $a_0 \sim 0.59$, obviously in stark contrast to EMC.  This is the original ``spin crisis''.  And of course $a_0 = 2<S_z^{quarks}>$.
% 
% Any need to mention ``Cloudy Bag'' model here?  I think not.
