\section{Triggering and Data Acquisition}

STAR's proton-proton physics program stretches the capabilities of the triggering system with a rich array of algorithms and thresholds.  The basic building block of nearly all physics analyses in the 200 GeV pp program is the minimum-bias (MB) trigger, defined by coincident signals in the two BBCs.  On top of the MB trigger STAR layers a variety of requirements based on signals in the electromagnetic calorimeters that bias the event sample towards rare events with large transverse energy depositions.

The dominant trigger algorithm in this analysis is the BEMC jet patch (JP) trigger, which sums transverse energy depositions over fixed groups of 400 towers covering an area of $\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi$ = 1.0 $\times$ 1.0.  The JP triggers were designed for efficient, minimally-biased selection of high-energy jets.  The threshold for the primary JP trigger in the 2005(2006) run was 6.4(8.3) GeV, and the integrated luminosity sampled by the trigger was ??(??) $pb^{-1}$.
