Many autors formulate precise 
definition of O-O paradigm 
\cite{Rentsch:1982} 
\cite{Pascoe:1986}
\cite{Nygaard:1986}
\cite{Madsen:1988}, 
and the definition of Lastly, Wegner 
\cite{Wegner:1987} has been 
the most widely 
accepted \cite{Capretz:2003}. Wegner defines 
the O-O paradigm in terms of objects, 
classes and inheritance.

\emph{
	``Objects are autonomous entities 
	that respond to messages or operations and share 
	a state. Classes classify objects by their common 
	operations. Inheritance serves to classify classes by 
	their shared behavior. Data abstraction hides the 
	representation of data and the implementation of 
	operations'' 
}\cite{Wegner:1987}. That is: 

object oriented = objects + classes + inheritance
