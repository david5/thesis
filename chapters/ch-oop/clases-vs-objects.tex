\section{Diference betwen Classes and Objects}

They are a clear separation between 
class and object, and they are 
the most important concepts of O-O programming 
languages. \cite{Dahl:1970} 
%this separation was fist introduced by Simula 
%to simulate real-world applications. 

A class is a static off-line 
template to generate objects. 
A object is a runtime data 
or a group of datas 
according to the class. The objects are 
independend datas with 
its own behavior, and 
they are classified by the classes
