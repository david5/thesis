\section{Inheritance}

The inheritance can be used as a way to define new classes 
based in more general classes that have been 
defined previously, acquiring their characteristics.  
If a class \emph{CurrentTransformer} directly 
inherits from class \emph{Transformer} we say that 
\emph{Transformer} is the parent 
of \emph{CurrentTransformer} and 
\emph{CurrentTransformer} is the 
child of \emph{Transformer} \cite{Snyder:1986}. 
The UML representation is given in 
Figure \ref{fig:inheritance-fig}.
