\subsection{Encapsulation}

The encapsulation is a technique for 
avoid dependencies among 
classes and modules by defining 
strict interfaces, and 
help for software 
maintenance, 
by information hidding,
understandability of code, 
localization of information,
narrow interfaces,  
and information restriction \cite{Lieberherr:1988}. 
%difference of information hidding 
%and information restriction are explained
%by the law of demeter paper Lieberherr:1988.
