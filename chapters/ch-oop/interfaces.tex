An interface is a collection of method declarations 
that allows unrelated objects to communicate with one 
another. 

Interfaces are based on the distinction between a 
method’s interface and its implementation. A method’s interface 
includes all the information necessary to invoke that 
method, including the name of the method, all of its 
parameters, and its return type. A method’s 
implementation includes not only the interface 
information, but also the executable statements 
that carry out the method’s behavior. An 
interface definition contains only method 
interfaces, and any class that implements 
the interface is responsible for defining the 
method implementations. \cite[pp.~90-105]{Adobe:AS3man2008}
