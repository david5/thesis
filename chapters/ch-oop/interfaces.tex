\subsection{Intefaces}

A external interface is a group of 
methods declarations of a class 
that allows that serves to comunicate the class
with other classes and thus between the 
designer of the class with 
another classes. The other clases should 
exist at the moment of the interface definition 
or could be created in the future 
\cite[pp.~90-105]{Adobe:AS3man2008} 
\cite{Snyder:1986}. 

The interface of a class serves 
to know how to interact with a determined
behabiour of the object, their input, ouput, 
and optionally the error handling parameters
but not knowing how the behavior is implemented.
