\section{Object oriented develoment approach}

The object-oriented development steps, 
first proposed by Aboott \cite{Abbott:1980} are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify the objects and their attributes.
  \item Identify the operations suffered by and required
		of each object.
  \item Establish the visibility of each object in 
		relation to other objects.
  \item Establish the interface of each object.
  \item Implement each object.  
\end{itemize}
