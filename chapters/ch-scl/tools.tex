\section{Tools}

According to the functionality, the tools for 
SCL engineering steps 
mentioned in section \ref{sec:SCL-engineering-parts} are
classified in the IEC 61850-6 \cite{IEC61850-6:2004} as
follows:

\subsection{IED configurator tool}
Support SCL importing and exporting generating IED specific 
configuration files and providing IED specific settings.

\subsection{System configurator tool}
\label{sec:ch-scl--System-configurator-tool}
The system configuration tool in conformance
with the IEC 61850-6 \cite{IEC61850-6:2004} can import 
configuration files from several \glspl{IED}, 
export configuration files and generate 
substation related configuration files.
