\section{Substation Configuration Language: Definition}
\label{sec:ch-scl--SCL-definition}
The \gls{SCL} is
\emph{
``
	a file format for describing communication related
	\gls{IED} configurations and \gls{IED} parameters, 
	communication system configurations, 
	switchyard (function) structures, and the
	relations between them. The main purpose of this format 
	is to exchange IED capability descriptions, 
	and SA system descriptions 
	between \gls{IED} engineering tools and the system
	engineering tool(s) of different manufacturers 
	in a compatible way
''
} \cite{IEC61850-6:2004}. The \gls{SCL} is a \gls{XML} based 
language with a sintax definition, structure and restrictions 
assigned to a W3C XML Shema \cite{W3CXSD:2001} (\gls{XSD} files
provided in Annex A of \cite{IEC61850-6:2004}). 

All the configurions of the system are modelled 
as a \gls{O-O} system, and all the configurable 
objects are described using \gls{SCL}.
