\section{Common services}

Is possible think of a network as providing the means for a set of application
processes that are distributed over those computers to communicate. In other
words, a requirement of a computer network is that the application
programs that runs on the hosts connected to the network must be able to
communicate in a meaningful way.

When two application programs need to communicate with each other, there
are a lot of complicated things that need to happen beyond simply sending a
message from one host to another. One option would be for application
designers to build all that complicated functionality into each application
program. However, since many applications need common services, it is much
more logical to implement those common services once and then to let the
application designer build the application using those services. 
The goal is to hide the complexity of the network from the application without
overly constraining the application 
designer. \cite[pp. 15]{PetersonDavie:2003}
