	\subsection{Classes of failure} 
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item When a packet is transmitted over a physical link:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Bit errors: 1 is turned into a 0 or vice versa.
					\item Burst error: Several consecutive bits are corrupted. 
				\end{itemize}
			\item At the packet level
				\begin{itemize}
                	\item The packet contains an uncorrectable bit error and
                	therefore has to be discarded.
                	\item One of the nodes that has to handle the packet is so
                	overloaded that it has no place to store the packet, and
                	therefore is forced to drop it.
					%\item Packet error: Complete packet is lost by the network.
				\end{itemize}
			\item Node and link level
				\begin{itemize}
					\item A physical link is cut
					\item The computer it is connected to crashes.
